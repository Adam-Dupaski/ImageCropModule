# ImageCropModule
This module can transform images based on a selection made in the browser.

## Typical usage scenario

- Allow users to crop images.

- Allow users to shrink or convert their images.

- Enforcing a set size/aspect ratio or allowing the user control it.

## Configuration 

- The module is pre-configured to use the **ImageCrop** entity, you can choose to inherit from this entity, set an association to the entity or copy the actions you want to have. 

- The **Cropper** widget and Java actions are compatible with any subclass of `System.Image` as long as it has the following attributes of type `integer` with the following given names (**_must be identical_**) **crop_x1 , crop_x2 , crop_y1 , crop_y2 , crop_height , crop_width**.
- Once you have decided on the entities and relationships in the domain models, you can either use the existing pages or use your own pages.

## Default functionality

The `CropImage_Overview` snippet allows you to upload new images using a simple new/edit button.

After uploading the image you can edit the image. Pressing the button `Edit Image` will create a new **draft** copy of the original image and opens page `CropImage_Crop`.

The page `CropImage_Crop` allows you to edit the draft image.


- **Crop**  changes the image. This will crop the area outside the box.

- **Resize** changes the image to the size of the selection box.

- **Grayscale** converts the image to an image in black/white (grayscale).

- **Aspect Ratio** clicking on the aspect ratio allows the user to change the Aspect Ratio and force the selection to be in a specific ratio.  

Clicking the button opens a popup and allows the user to change the ratio to a valid ratio such as **4:3** or reset it to blank or 0 for a free selection shape. 

- **Apply Changes** copies the image as you see it in the draft back into the original CropImage. The page is closed, and the draft is being removed.

- **Revert Changes** reverts all changes and re-copies the image from the original image and allows you to start over again.

- **ThumbnailSize** this changes the size of the thumbnail that will be created after altering an image. Any of the buttons will force the thumbnail to be re-created in this size.

> Please Note: If you change this constant it is recommended to change the thumbnail size on the image upload widget as well with the same value. This keeps all thumbnails consistently in the same size.

*If you choose to use your own entity or if you want to alter the implementation you can choose to change the widget or the Java actions.*

## Widget - Cropper

### Widget properties:

- **Max width**: The maximum width that cropping viewport will stretch to. Use **0** for no maximum width.

- **Max height**: The maximum height that cropping viewport will stretch to. Use **0** for no maximum height.

> If both **Max width** and **Max height** are set to **0** the cropping viewport will be set to the true/natural image size.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: When dealing with large images it is recommended to set at least one of the above mentioned properties.**

- **Start height**: The initial height of the cropping window.

- **Start width**: The initial width of the cropping window.

- **Aspect Ratio**: The aspect ratio that will be applied on the cropping window.

## Java actions parameters & configuration:

- **cropImgObj** :  the object (that has the neccessary attributes) to be resized.

- **new Width/Height** : Make sure your `newWidth` and `newHeight` match the aspect ratio used in the widget to make sure the image doesn't get transformed inconsistently.

- If you set either the `newWidth` or the `newHeight` to **0**, it will scale the image based on the filled in value whilst keeping the aspect ratio. 

- If you set both on **0** it will use the width and height set by the user with the widget. 

- **thumbnail Width/Height** : The size of the thumbnail, editable so you can keep this on or near the same aspect ratio as the new image. The default implementation will use the tumbnail size as configured in the **Configuration/ThumbnailSize** unless the image is smaller than the thumbnail.
